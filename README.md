#Info
This a demo recipesApp implemented using react+redux, and structured with reduxDucks pattern. One can add,remove and search from the foodRecipes displayed on the page

[NOTE]: react-redux has been used to further refactor the application,  giving components access to Redux (store) without props drilling.

Selectors are thus used to access all / part of the (state) in the Redux Store.

useSelector()  retrieves the application (state) through selectors and called
within a components

useSelector() subscribes components to data retrieved from selectors. React, not Redux, re-renders those components when the selected data changes.

useDispatch() returns reference to Redux store dispatch() function.

[NOTE 2]: Slices has been further been refactored with reduxToolkit, eliminating the creation of (actionCreators and reducers), enhancing readability and reducing 
boiler plate codes

[Immer library] in reduxToolkit has been used to write code that 
'mutates' the [state] inside [case-reducers] passed to [createSlice],
because it will safely and accurately return an immutable updated state

**The {store} setup process has also been simplified by eliminating
the use of [createStore(combineReducers(rootReducers)))] with a single function in the reduxToolKit(RTK) which is [configureStore(reducer arg)] 
which accepts a reducer as argument and handles most of the store setup
process automatically.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
